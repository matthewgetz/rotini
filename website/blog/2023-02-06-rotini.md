### 🍝&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why rotini?

There are many Node CLI Frameworks and Flag Parsers (argv) available in the npm registry.

Full-featured packages like [commander](https://www.npmjs.com/package/commander), [oclif](https://www.npmjs.com/package/oclif), [yargs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/yargs), and [caporal](https://www.npmjs.com/package/caporal) are battle-tested CLI framework options, but they approach the problem with a programmatic solution—programs and their commands are built entirely with code.  
Powerful and lightweight flag parsers like [minimist](https://www.npmjs.com/package/minimist) are massively popular for their accuracy and ease of use, but they provide less overall CLI scaffolding and out-of-the-box functionality.

CLI programs made with rotini use a declarative structure rather than a programmatic structure.  
After writing your program definition and configuration, only two lines of code are required to run your program!

Try it out!  

```mdx-code-block
<Tabs>
<TabItem value="JavaScript">
```

```js
const rotini = require('rotini');
const definition = require('./definition');
const configuration = require('./configuration');

(async () => {
  const program = rotini({ definition, configuration, });
  const result = await program.run().catch(program.error);
  result && console.info(result);
})();
```

```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="TypeScript">
```

```js
import rotini from 'rotini';
import definition from './definition';
import configuration from './configuration';

void (async (): Promise<void> => {
  const program = rotini({ definition, configuration, });
  const result = await program.run().catch(program.error);
  result && console.info(result);
})();
```

```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>
</Tabs>
```
