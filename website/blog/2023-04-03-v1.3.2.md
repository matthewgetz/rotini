rotini v1.3.2 has been released!  
See the [documentation](/docs/1.3.5) for more information.  

### 💀&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Breaking Changes
- 🍝&nbsp;&nbsp;removal of the rotini cli (npx rotini generate my-cli)
  - the rotini cli caused unintended and unpredictable bundle issues depending on the bundler (esbuild), causing argv parameters to be consumed by the rotini cli itself
  - the added bloat of the rotini cli is hard to justify at this time - significant overhead is required to build the internal cli into the package, but for very little gain (a small generated hello-world cli)
  - at some point in the future, rotini generate, doc building tools, and packaging tools will be added to an optional add-on project under the `@rotini` org (this keeps the main package light and performing as intended)

### 🔧&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Changes
- 📝&nbsp;&nbsp;documentation is now hosted at [rotini.dev](https://rotini.dev)
- 🚨&nbsp;&nbsp;`program.flags` has been renamed to `program.global_flags`
  - this is a clarifying change that additionally lays the groundwork for a future change to how rotini logically separates flag types
    - rotini will soon have a concept of global (program) flags, positional (first arg passed) flags, and local (command) flags
- ✅&nbsp;&nbsp;ParseObject type surfaced to easily type operation input parameters
  ```js
  const operation = (parsed: ParseObject): number[] => {
    const { commands, global_flags } = parsed;
    return [1,2,3];
  };
  ```
